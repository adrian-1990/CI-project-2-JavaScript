# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game!

## Introduction


## UX - User Experience Design

The site is created for user to have fun and challenge the computer to a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The site can be used by new and return users. I want the site to have a bright and welcoming design to encourage users to return.

### Strategy

The site should be easy to use for new and return users. The site should have all the rules clearly visable, the icons should be interactive for users and you should find out the winner of each round.

### Scope

### Structure

The game title will tell users what game they are playing. There is a section for players to select what they want to play, a section to annoucne the winner and a section that contains the rules so user can know why they won / lost. There is a scoreboard to keep track of who is winning betweent the user and computer.

### Skeleton

I created my initial design on Balsamiq Wireframes to get an initial idea for the layout of the site on PC and mobile. As I was creating the site my layout changed slightly to what I originally planned.
